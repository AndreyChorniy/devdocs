Vendor Bundled Extensions (VBEs) are third-party extensions that we have thoroughly tested and included with each supported version of {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}}.

Current VBEs include:

-  Amazon Pay
-  Dotdigital (formerly Dotmailer)
-  Klarna
-  Vertex
-  Yotpo

{:.bs-callout-info}
Installing or upgrading Magento also installs VBEs, but you may need to set up an account with a vendor to configure and use an extension.

The following table shows VBE version compatibility with Magento:
